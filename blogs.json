But, it required killing off the updation part where the error took place and moving on to the next updation part. Even till this point, it was seemingly looking better, but after digging deep and getting to know that the errors raised by the classes, modules, etc in this technique would have to be handled all around the codebase with rescue blocks and not only the course updation path, this technique was\u00a0dropped.</p>\n<p>The storage part of course update error records in the database was smooth enough with very minor problems. Along the way in the search of a better architecture, I eventually with the help of a co-intern and my mentor, dropped the idea of storing the error records, which would bring me to my <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shashwatkathuria7/an-amazing-architecture-tracking-errors-by-storing-only-2-variables-via-sentry-e90ac7690067\"><strong>next\u00a0blog</strong></a>.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=55d9aa38467d\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["wiki-ed-dashboard","error-handling","gsoc","error-tracking","gsoc-2020"]},{"title":"My GSoC Selection &amp; Community Bonding Experience","pubDate":"2020-05-26 20:08:46","link":"https://medium.com/@shashwatkathuria7/my-gsoc-selection-community-bonding-experience-280e1bda4f56?source=rss-bb0e8438466------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/280e1bda4f56","author":"Shashwat Kathuria","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h4>(<a href=\"https://medium.com/@shashwatkathuria7/the-starting-exploring-error-tracking-techniques-55d9aa38467d\">Next Blog</a>)</h4>\n<p>I\u2019ve been hearing about <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/\"><strong>Google Summer of Code</strong></a> since I have started college and always wondered what it was like, to be part of such a prestigious program, and code in real world projects with mentors\u2026\u2026Fast forward three years, I get selected as a <a href=\"https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5951408089595904\"><strong>GSoC intern</strong></a> for <a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/\"><strong>Wikimedia Foundation</strong></a>!!</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*gJoW7vrs0zyau5rU9OPuRQ.jpeg\"></figure><p><strong>The Organization</strong></p>\n<p>So, starting to contribute is always the toughest period in my opinion, it takes some decent amount of effort to understand the code base, how things work and even more so to give sensible logical contributions apart from the usual UI bugs and testing.
